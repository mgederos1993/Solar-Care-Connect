## Troubleshooting

If the webpage shows "loading" then goes blank:

2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

## Common Issues & Solutions

**"Loading" then blank page**:
- Usually means JavaScript errors are preventing React from mounting
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- The new error boundary will show a retry button if React fails

**GitHub Pages not updating**:
- Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repo
- Make sure the workflow completed successfully
- GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update

**App works locally but not on GitHub Pages**:

- Check that all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify the build process completes without errors
