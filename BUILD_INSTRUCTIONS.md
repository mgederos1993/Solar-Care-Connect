## What's Fixed

âœ… **Added missing build:web script**: Now properly defined in package.json
âœ… **Simplified netlify.toml**: Removed complex build commands that were causing failures
âœ… **Fixed Node.js version**: Specified Node 20 consistently

âœ… **Proper Expo web configuration**: Updated app.json for web builds
âœ… **Metro config**: Added for better web compatibility

npm run build:web
```

```

## Alternative Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages
1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails with dependency errors**:
- The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag should resolve React version conflicts
- All required dependencies are now properly listed

**"Missing script" errors**:
- All required scripts are now in package.json
- `build:web` runs `npx expo export --platform web` to create static files

**Node version issues**:
- Node 20 is specified in `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, and `netlify.toml`
- Netlify will use Node 20 for the build
